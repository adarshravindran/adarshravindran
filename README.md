Hi, I’m Adarsh Ravindran. 

I am currently studying masters in Applied Mathematics.

I have worked as a business analyst for two years, and also have a B.Tech in chemical engineering.

I'm interested in working on data science, data analytics, and numerical methods for solving PDEs.

I am yet to update my github profile with the codes I have worked on, I will be doing so soon.

You can contact me at adarshravindran29@gmail.com
