Hi, I’m Adarsh Ravindran. 

I have worked as a Business Analyst over two years. Later pursued my Masters in Applied Mathematics (UHH, Germany) with a Bachelor in Chemical Engineering (NITH, India).

My masters thesis focused on nonlinear time series analysis. I'm interested in working on machine learning models in nonlinear forecasting.
