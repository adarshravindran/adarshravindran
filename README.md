Hi, I’m Adarsh Ravindran. 

I have worked as a Business Analyst over two years, with Masters in Applied Mathematics and Bachelors in Chemical Engineering.

I'm interested in working on machine learning models in nonlinear forecasting.

I am yet to update my github profile with the codes I have worked on, I will be doing so soon.

You can contact me at adarshravindran29@gmail.com
